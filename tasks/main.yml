# Note escaping required here - we need to pass "{{ .Server.Version }}" to Docker without it
# being escaped by Ansible. However, normal ways of escaping it will result in the command
# containing that string, and when we register the result the "cmd" field on the result will also
# contain it. So next time any kind of templating command is run, Ansible will try to resolve
# template expressions in all of its variables, including that one, and will show an error.
# Hence this workaround with shell.
# In Ansible 2.0, they added the "!unsafe" keyword, which may provide a cleaner way to resolve
# this.
